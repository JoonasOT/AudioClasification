# Simple repo for COMP.SGN.120 project

Usage:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JoonasOT/AudioClassification.git
```

We recommend using a python virtual environment, but can be ran with just the
system base interpreter. The user just needs to have installed the packages listed
in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). This can be easily done with the command
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
but when using this command with the system interpreter, this will install the
packages to your system.
